**Question 1**
before running:
10 loops, 1second
we predict it will take 10 seconds to run

actual output (sleep_time): 10.012 seconds

**Question 2**
Numbers with the int type can only be integer values. Float allows the program to use decimal values as well.

The program would not run if these notations were removed/incorrect because any non integer values would cause an error.

**Question 3**
time.ticks_diff(toc, tic) will not incorrectly calculate the elapsed time if zero wraps around
